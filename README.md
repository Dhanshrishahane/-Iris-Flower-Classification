# -Iris-Flower-Classification
It involved implementing a machine learning model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on features like petal and sepal dimensions.

Technologies Used :-
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithm: Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Data Preprocessing:-
Applied scaling to normalize feature values.
Encoded categorical labels to numeric format for machine learning.

Model Development:-
Built a classification model using supervised learning techniques to predict the species of Iris flowers.
Optimized the model to achieve accurate predictions.
Real-Time Prediction:

Integrated functionality for real-time input of flower features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
Decoded the model's numeric predictions into human-readable species names using label encoding.

Features:
Interactive Input: Users can provide flower feature values to get species predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Ensures accurate model performance by standardizing input data.
Label Decoding: Converts numeric predictions back to categorical labels (species names).

Dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

The target variable includes three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Results:
The model achieved a high level of accuracy and demonstrated reliable predictions for unseen data. Visualizations of the dataset and model performance are included in the analysis notebook.
